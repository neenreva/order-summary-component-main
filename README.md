## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. In this project your asked to style a small card sized order summary. I'm trying to use less and less static values and make designs responsive as possible. SVGs are also new to me and I'm continually learning how to manipulate them.
